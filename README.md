# excel_coffee_sales


The project's methodology includes several key steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize sales trends, data preparation for machine learning, and training a simple linear regression model to predict sales. The project utilizes tools such as ML, SQL, and Excel, with the example code demonstrating the use of Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

The ultimate goal is to provide insights that can be used to optimize inventory planning, design vending machine layouts, and determine ideal restock times.

Project Overview

 * Objective: The analysis aims to understand customer purchasing patterns and sales trends from a coffee vending machine.
   
 * Dataset: The dataset covers daily transaction data from a vending machine from March 2024 to the present. It includes details such as date, time, cash type, card number, money, and coffee name.
   
 * Methodology: The project used Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find patterns and trends in sales data. It also includes a machine learning model using a Linear Regression model to predict sales.



Key Findings

 * Popular Products:
   
   * Americano with Milk and Latte are the most popular coffee products and also generate the highest revenue.
     
   * Cappuccino and Americano are in the second tier of popularity.
     
   * Cocoa and Espresso have the lowest sales.

     
 * Sales Trends:
   
   * Americano with Milk and Latte sales show an upward trend over time.
  
   * Tuesday has the highest sales of the week, while other days are relatively similar.
     
   * Two peak hours for sales are observed daily: 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM.
     
 * Customer Behavior:
   
   * Approximately 92% of transactions were made using a card.
     
   * Transactions with missing card information were all from cash users.
     
   * All products generally experience a peak in sales around 10:00 AM.
     
   * Certain products like Cappuccino, Cocoa, and Hot Chocolate are more popular in the evening, specifically between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM.
Business Implications

 * Inventory and Planning: The findings on popular products and sales trends can be used to optimize inventory planning and determine ideal restock times for coffee products.
   
 * Vending Machine Optimization: The analysis provides valuable insights for designing the layout of vending machines.
   
 * Marketing and Strategy: Understanding peak hours and popular products can inform targeted marketing campaigns and promotions.
